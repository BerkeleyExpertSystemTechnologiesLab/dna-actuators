# dna-actuators
Simulations, analytical models, and data collection for DNA-Structured Linear Actuators in the BEST Lab.
The files are in MATLAB.
Updated for ASME JMR submission.

Folders:

data/ - simulation data and saved data files.
      	note that as of this commit, the experimental data is inside the
	actual m-files under 'experiments.'
	
experiments/ - scripts that either perform the simulation experiments, or
	     graph recorded data from other experiments

img/ - location of saved images, generated by scripts

simulations/ - the functions which actually simulate the lengths etc. of the actuators

visualizations/ - scripts and functions that provide visualizations of the
		actuators, both helical and straight-line.

To recreate the results from the paper submissions, run the scripts inside experiments.
See the functions under simulations for the software implementation of the analytical models in the paper.
